# numerical-methods
This repository contains a broad collection of algorithms designed to implement mathematical concepts, techniques, and processes for different purposes (pretty much everything and anything from the bisection method to drawing cool graphs for their own sake). Code implementations are arranged roughly by the topic/method being illustrated. Some programs utilize multiple techniques simultaneously or in a nested fashion.
