**Trapezoidal Rule**

Approximate a definite integral using the trapezoidal rule.

trapezoid_rule.cpp input(s):
   - Lower and upper bounds of integration, `a`, `b` (user-input).
   - Function to be integrated, `f(x)` (hard-coded).
   - Number of grid points to utilize, `N` (user-input).  Must be at least 2.

trapezoid_rule.cpp output(s):
   - Approximated value of the integral (terminal-print).
