Dragon Curve Algorithm: generates the dragon curve (recursive fractal) for a user specified number of iterations.

dragon_curve.cpp input(s):
	- Number of iterations, N (user-input).
	- Curve orientation and chirality (user-input).

dragon_curve.cpp output(s):
	- dragon_curve.txt file containing the x, y coordinates (colums 1, 2, respectively) for the corresponding dragon curve with the user specified orientation and chirality up to the desired number of iterations.  This file may be directly inputed to any suitable 2D graphing software for vizualization, such as xmgrace.
