**Gauss-Jordan Elimination**

Solve a user specified linear system of equations, Ax = b, (of order `N`).

gauss_jordan.cpp input(s):
   - `system.txt` file, containing the system to be solved.  This file has the order of the system, `N`, in the first line, along with the entries of `A`, one row per line, with the corresponding entries of `b` at the end of each row.  Note that the system must have a unique solution for the code to function properly.

gauss_jordan.cpp output(s):
   - Unique solution to the system (terminal-print).
