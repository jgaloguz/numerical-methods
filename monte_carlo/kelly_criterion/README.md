**Kelly Criterion with Monte Carlo Method**

Use a Monte Carlo approach to verify the Kelly criterion.

kelly_criterion.cpp input(s):
   - How many bets to place per MC trial, `N` (hard-coded).
   - How many MC trials to run, `M` (hard-coded).
   - Probability of winning, `p` (hard-coded).
   - Fraction gained with win, `g` (hard-coded).
   - Fraction lost with loss, `l` (hard-coded).

kelly_criterion.cpp output(s):
   - `return.txt` file with mean squared error of method with sample size.
