**Area Estimate with Monte Carlo Method**

Use a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the area of a circle and illustrate the mean squared error convergence of the method.

area.cpp input(s):
   - How many samples to obtain per MC trial, `N` (hard-coded).
   - How many MC trials to run, `M` (hard-coded).
   - Circle's radius, `R` (hard-coded).

area.cpp output(s):
   - `error.txt` file with mean squared error of method with sample size.
   - Estimate of circle's area after `N` samples (terminal-print).
